# Security Policy

This document aims to provide instructions about how to report security vulnerabilities. Jandig, as an open-source community, prizes this kind of interaction since we'll use these pieces of information for tracking and correcting defects.


## Reporting Security Issues

At Jandig, we value keeping the security integrity of the platform. Therefore, vulnerabilities reports and issues related to security are welcome and must be made through GitHub issues.
Before creating a report issue, you must collect data about the vulnerability, such as print screens and paths for reaching the problem. Once you have collected all the information needed to reproduce the error, you must now describe it as a bug report issue. You can find more details about how to create a issue on [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/memeLab/Jandig/blob/develop/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) document.    


## Language

We prefer to keep all internal communication of the project in English.

# Jandig ARte
ARte is a Progressive Web App for augmented reality artworks. Our goal is to give a way for artists share their artworks in a simple and free way.

You can see galleries with pictures of [exhibitions](http://memelab.com.br/jandig/exposicoes/) created with Jandig.

## How it works
Jandig ARte uses image pattern detection to detect [augmented reality markers](https://www.kudan.eu/kudan-news/augmented-reality-fundamentals-markers/) through the camera of a device and render a content (currently a GIF) on the device screen, giving the impression that your device is like a virtual window that you are looking at.

Jandig ARte is a Progressive Web App, which means you can open in every device with a browser and a camera. Also you can add Jandig ARte to your homescreen and it will run like a native app on your device.

### Collab
We are looking for artists (both illustrators and animators) to create great content and help us testing the platform, people to translate our website from Portuguese to English (and vice versa), and developers to help us with the platform, please contact us via the Telegram channel or an issue on GitHub!

### Clipping
You can find interviews and references to Jandig in the press [here](http://memelab.com.br/jandig/clipping/).

## Get Started
To contribute to Jandig ARte it would be awesome if you read [Contributing](https://github.com/memeLab/ARte/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) and our [Code of conduct](https://github.com/memeLab/ARte/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). After a good read you are ready to move foward!

### Prerequisites
We use docker and docker-compose to ensure a consistent development environment and to make the deploy process as painless as possible, so all you need on your development tools to run Jandig ARte is [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker-Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/). 
<br>On Windows [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/) also includes Docker Compose along with other Docker apps.

### Installing
Docker has good documentation on their website for installing docker and docker-compose for different operating systems like [Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/) and [Debian](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/). To install docker-compose choose your operating system [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). <br>
On Windows, you'll only need install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/) and [WSL2](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/#wsl-2-backend).

### Running

#### Linux OS

To run Jandig ARte all you need to do is:
- Clone this repo
- Navigate to the repository folder
- Run docker-compose
- Voila!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/memeLab/Jandig
cd Jandig
docker-compose up
```
If you get any error saying ``permission denied`` try run the command with sudo.
```
sudo docker-compose up
```

Jandig ARte server will run at localhost. To test modifications you just need to run a web browser and access [localhost:8000](localhost:8000). If you want to test on a mobile device, you will need a https connection, we recommend [ngrok](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngrok) to generate a https link for you.

```
sudo snap install ngrok
ngrok http 8000
```

ngrok will prompt 3 links:

Select the one with `https` at beginning.

#### Windows OS

To run Jandig ARte all you need to do is:
- Clone this repo
- Navigate to the repository folder using WSL2
- Run the conteiners 'jandigarte/django' and 'jandigarte/requirements' on Docker Desktop
- Run docker-compose passing the docker-compose.yml
- Voila!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/memeLab/Jandig
cd Jandig
docker-compose up
```
If you get any error saying ``permission denied`` try run the command with sudo.
```
sudo docker-compose up
```

Jandig ARte server will run at localhost, but by default WSL2 enables wsl localhost to accessible from windows, but no vice versa. To access you'll need to use windows system IP from wsl2.

- Run this command on terminal:
```
vim /etc/resolv.conf
```
- Get Network Interface (WSL) IP. It should be like:
```
nameserver 172.21.176.1
```
- Access the localhost using this IP (e.g.: 172.21.176.1:8000)
